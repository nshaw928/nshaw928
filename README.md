## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nick
I'm a student at the University of Cincinnati, studying medical sciences. My experience within structural biology
allowed me to start utilizing python as a tool for my research, and I am excited to approach these complex topics
computationally to help support scientific bench research.
## ðŸ‘€ What am I up to now?
Currently, I am developing a method to analyze complex networks of protein-protein interactions entirely from prediction
methods *(AlphaFold and friends)*. I am conducting this work as a part of the [Brown Lab](https://brown.hms.harvard.edu/)
at Harvard Medical School, while being supported by the [Barry Goldwater Scholarship](https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/).
## ðŸŒ± What's Next?
I am excited to learn more math, statistics, and computer science. Specifically I'm interested in learning more:
- Bayesian Statistics
- Data Visualization
- Pandas Optimization
- Machine Learning Methods
